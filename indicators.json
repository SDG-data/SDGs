Data collected through these tools may be used to inform an assessment that would be comparable with the ones obtained by FAO using the FIES in other countries. Over time, ownership of the FIES indicators will be transferred to countries that may start producing their own data. FCS data is collected around the world by WFP, NGOs, and government partners are often collected within the context of larger/broader food security monitoring systems (FSMS). FSMS surveys and associated household questionnaires typically include a number of core modules; household demographics, income sources, expenditures, food consumption and food sources, coping strategies and shocks.  A typical completed FSMS household questionnaire, if collected using a conventional 'face-to-face' (i.e. on site enumerator and respondent) approach, costs approximately $30.  For the purpose of providing a rough estimate of the cost and feasibility of collecting only the FCS data together with the standard household demographic data, we estimate the cost at approximately $15 to $20 per household using the conventional face-to-face approach for data collection.
